## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this first challenge I used a new resource that I had never used in my projects, which is @media screen and (max-width:). Which made it clearer to me how to make a website with fluid responsiveness that supports multiple screen sizes.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .qr-card {
    width: 300px;
    height: 450px;
    border-radius: 22.5px;
  }

  .qr-code {
    height: 270px;
    width: 270px;
    border-radius: 15px;
  }

  .main-text {
    margin: 15px;
    font-size: 14pt;
  }
  .text-field {
    font-size: 10pt;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I want to further improve the responsiveness of my codes and make them cleaner and easier to read, in addition to using new technologies, libraries and Frameworks in my projects such as React, Tailwhind, Angular.
